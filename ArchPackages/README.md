# ArchPackages  

Various PKGBUILDS I've made for my own personal usage. They are in no way tailored to fit any other system but my own, and they make assumptions that's only true for me. They don't follow the AUR guidelines, and probably never will, I only keep them as PKGBUILDs because that's how I prefer to install custom packages on my system.
